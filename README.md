A shell project in C involves creating a command-line interpreter. Users input commands, which the shell parses to identify the command and its arguments. The shell forks a new process to execute the command using the exec family of functions. It supports built-in commands, handles basic input/output redirection, and allows for background execution. The project also incorporates environment variables, signal handling for Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Z, and a simple command history feature.
